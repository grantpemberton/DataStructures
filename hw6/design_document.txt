Each lyric word is going to be stored in a hash table. The key associated with 
that word will be able to be hashed to the table index for which that word is 
held. Each index of the hash table of words will contain a word struct. The
word struct is as follows:

struct Lyric{
	priorityQueue *songList [11];
	string word;
	int key;
};

each member in the priorityQueue, songList is going to be another struct:

struct lyricFreq{
	string word;
	Song identity;
};
